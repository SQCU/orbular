# Code Review: Comparison with Google Research Implementation

This review compares the local implementations of `spherical_cnn.py` and `spherical_attention.py` with the canonical implementation in `google-research-spherical-cnn/spherical_cnn/layers.py`.

### `spherical_cnn.py` vs. `google-research-spherical-cnn/spherical_cnn/layers.py`

The local `spherical_cnn.py` is a much simpler, single-purpose implementation compared to the general-purpose, highly modular, and configurable `layers.py` from Google Research.

**Key Differences in Calculation:**

1.  **Spins**: The local implementation does not explicitly handle different spin values. It implicitly assumes spin-0 inputs and outputs. The Google Research implementation, on the other hand, is built around the concept of spin-weighted spherical harmonics and explicitly handles input and output spins. This is a major difference that could invalidate the local network design for tasks requiring non-zero spins.
2.  **Batching and `vmap`**: The local implementation uses explicit for-loops for batching, channels, and other dimensions. The Google Research code uses `jax.vmap` to efficiently map operations over the batch dimension. This is a significant performance difference, especially on accelerators like TPUs.
3.  **Non-linearity**: The local code uses a simple `nn.ReLU`. The Google Research code implements several more sophisticated non-linearities like `MagnitudeNonlinearity` and `PhaseCollapseNonlinearity`, which are designed to be equivariant for complex-valued, spin-weighted functions. Using a simple ReLU on complex data (or its magnitude) can break equivariance.
4.  **Batch Normalization**: The local implementation does not have batch normalization. The Google Research code has a `SpinSphericalBatchNormalization` that correctly handles the statistics of spherical data, including a spectral-domain version for efficiency.

**Performance Uplifts:**

1.  **`jax.vmap`**: As mentioned, using `vmap` instead of explicit loops is a major performance win on both CPUs and accelerators. This is a change that should be adopted in the local implementation.
2.  **Spectral Batch Normalization**: Performing batch normalization in the spectral domain, as done in `SpinSphericalSpectralBatchNormalization`, is more efficient and accurate than doing it in the spatial domain. This is a key optimization from the paper that is missing in the local code.
3.  **JAX vs. PyTorch**: The Google Research code uses JAX, which is known for its performance on TPUs. While PyTorch is also highly optimized, for TPU-centric workflows, JAX often has an edge. The principles, however (like `vmap`), are transferable.

### `spherical_attention.py` vs. `google-research-spherical-cnn/spherical_cnn/layers.py`

The Google Research repository does not contain a direct equivalent to `SphericalMultiHeadAttention`. The `layers.py` file focuses on convolutional building blocks. Therefore, a direct comparison is not possible. However, we can infer some best practices from the Google Research code that should be applied to the local `spherical_attention.py`:

1.  **Use of `vmap`**: The attention mechanism would also benefit from `vmap` to avoid explicit loops over batch and head dimensions.
2.  **Spins**: A more general implementation of spherical attention would need to handle spins, which would require a more complex formulation of the Q, K, and V projections.
3.  **Non-linearities and Normalization**: The principles of using equivariant non-linearities and spherical batch normalization would also apply to the attention mechanism.

### Recommendations

1.  **Adopt `vmap`**: The most critical and universally applicable performance uplift is to replace explicit Python loops with `torch.vmap` (the PyTorch equivalent of `jax.vmap`). This will provide a significant speedup on both CPUs and accelerators.
2.  **Implement Spin-Weighted Operations**: For the local implementations to be truly comparable to the paper and the Google Research code, they need to be extended to handle spin-weighted functions. This is a significant undertaking that would require a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics.
3.  **Incorporate Equivariant Non-linearities and Normalization**: The simple `ReLU` should be replaced with something like the `PhaseCollapseNonlinearity` from the paper. Similarly, a proper spherical batch normalization should be added.
4.  **Refactor for Modularity**: The Google Research code is highly modular, with clear separation of concerns between the convolution logic, non-linearities, and normalization layers. The local code would benefit from a similar refactoring, which would make it easier to experiment with different architectures.

In summary, the local implementations are a good starting point for understanding the basic concepts, but they are missing several key features and optimizations from the canonical Google Research implementation. The most important changes to adopt are the use of `vmap` for performance and the proper handling of spins and equivariant non-linearities for correctness and generalizability.
