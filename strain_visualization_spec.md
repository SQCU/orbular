# Strain Field Visualization Specification

## 1. Objective

To create a clear and intuitive 3D visualization of a spin-2 (S2) strain field's effect on a spin-0 (S0) object on the sphere. The visualization should represent the strain as a tangible geometric volume rather than just a deformation of points.

## 2. Concept: The "Strained Sheath"

The proposed method visualizes the S2 strain field as a translucent "sheath" or "hull" that envelops the S0 object. The geometry of this sheath directly encodes the strain information:

*   **Direction:** The sheath will be elongated in the direction of the strain (the "stretch" axis).
*   **Magnitude:** The thickness of the sheath will be proportional to the magnitude of the strain at that point.

This approach makes the abstract strain field visible and physically palpable.

## 3. Algorithm

The visualization will be generated through the following steps:

1.  **Isolate S0 Objects:** The input S0 SDF tensor is first decoded into a binary mask. This mask is then processed to identify distinct, connected components (the individual letters or shapes).

2.  **Calculate Deformation Field:** For each point on the sphere, a 3D deformation vector is calculated from the S2 strain tensor. This vector lies in the tangent plane of the sphere and represents the direction and magnitude of the strain at that point.

3.  **Generate Displaced Point Clouds:** For each connected S0 component, two new point clouds are generated:
    *   `P_positive`: The original points of the object, displaced outwards along the deformation vectors.
    *   `P_negative`: The original points, displaced inwards along the deformation vectors.

4.  **Compute Convex Hull:** The `P_positive` and `P_negative` point clouds are combined. A 3D convex hull is then computed for this combined set of points. This hull forms the geometric "sheath" that envelops the object.

5.  **Render Translucent Hull:** The final step is to render the computed convex hull using a 3D plotting library. The faces of the hull are drawn with a high degree of translucency (e.g., alpha < 0.3), allowing the original S0 object (which can be rendered inside) to be visible. The process is repeated for each S0 component.

## 4. Expected Outcome

The final output will be a 3D plot where each object from the S0 field is encased in its own custom-fitted, translucent sheath. The shape of the sheath will immediately reveal the underlying strain field structure as it pertains to the object, providing a much richer and more interpretable visualization than a simple color map or point deformation.
