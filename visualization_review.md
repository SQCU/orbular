# Visualization Review

This document analyzes the visual clarity, rendering decisions, and input data representation across three sets of visualizations: Spherical Word V1, Spherical CNN Demo, and the S0-S2 Loss/Reconstruction demos.

## 1. Spherical Word V1 (`spherical_word_v1_visualization.png`)

*   **Visual Clarity:** Excellent. The three-panel layout (Input Mask, Target S-SDF, Decoded Texture) is clear and easy to follow. The use of a perceptually uniform colormap for the S-SDF is effective.
*   **Rendering Decisions:** The 2D projection (equirectangular) is appropriate for this stage of the process. The "Decoded Texture" panel provides a good qualitative sense of the model's performance.
*   **Input Data:** The input data consists of multiple, discrete "words" (in this case, letters) placed at different locations on the sphere. This is a good representation of a realistic use case.

## 2. Spherical CNN Demo (`spherical_cnn_demo_output.png`)

*   **Visual Clarity:** Good, but could be improved. The four-panel layout is informative, but the "Model Output" and "Error Surface" are difficult to interpret without more context. The colormaps are well-chosen.
*   **Rendering Decisions:** Like the V1 visualization, this uses a 2D equirectangular projection. This is suitable for showing the overall shape of the fields.
*   **Input Data:** The input is a single, continuous path (a letter 'C'). While useful for debugging, this is less representative of a real-world scenario than the multi-word input of the V1 demo.

## 3. S0-S2 Loss and Reconstruction (`s0_s2_loss_visualization.png`, `s0_s2_reconstruction_loss.png`, `s0_s2_reconstruction_original.png`)

*   **Visual Clarity:** Poor.
    *   `s0_s2_loss_visualization.png`: The 2D loss visualization is clear on its own, but it's disconnected from the 3D reconstructions.
    *   `s0_s2_reconstruction_loss.png`: The whole-sphere rendering obscures the actual data of interest (the "tangled letters"). The visualization is cluttered and difficult to interpret.
    *   `s0_s2_reconstruction_original.png`: This is much better, as it only shows the extruded text. However, it's still not as clear as the V1 or CNN demos.
*   **Rendering Decisions:** The decision to render the full sphere in `s0_s2_reconstruction_loss.png` is the primary issue. The transparent-background, text-only rendering in `s0_s2_reconstruction_original.png` is a significant improvement and should be the standard.
*   **Input Data:** The input data is a single, continuous great-circle path. As with the CNN demo, this is a step back from the more complex, multi-path data used in the V1 demo.

## Summary and Recommendations

The Spherical Word V1 demo sets the highest standard for clarity and data representation. The Spherical CNN demo is a reasonable middle ground, but its input data could be more complex. The S0-S2 demos, in their current state, are difficult to interpret and should be revised to adopt the best practices of the other two.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Adopt the V1 Standard:** The multi-path input data and clear, multi-panel layout of the Spherical Word V1 demo should be the goal for all visualizations.
2.  **Eliminate Whole-Sphere Rendering:** For 3D reconstructions, only the extruded text or relevant features should be rendered, against a transparent background.
3.  **Improve S0-S2 Visualizations:** The S0-S2 demos should be refactored to follow the recommendations above. The 2D loss plots should be more directly linked to the 3D reconstructions.
